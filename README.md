    - Angry Eggplant project
    - https://github.com/colental/ae

    >  server + client 
	- ready to run with no configuration

    >  26 modules - all executable with a simple command
        - reverse tcp:   remotely access host machine with a shell inspired by Meterpreter in the Metasploit Framework 
        - keylogger:     log user keystrokes with the window they were entered in
        - webcam:        capture image/video or stream live
        - screenshot:    snap shots of the host desktop
        - root access:   obtain administrator privileges
        - persistence:   maintain access with 8 different persistence methods
        - port scanner:  explore the local network for more hosts, open ports, vulnerabilities
        - packetsniffer: monitor host network traffic for valuable information
        - ransom:        encrypt host files and ransom them to the user for Bitcoin 
        - upload:        automatically upload results to Imgur, Pastebin, or a remote FTP server
	...and many more!

    >  Portability
        - "just works" on any system architecture, host platform, etc. - no configuration necessary
        - zero dependencies whatsoever (not even Python is required on the host machine)
        - dynamically generates deliverables as executables native to the host environment
        - no downloads, no installations, no configuration, no dependencies

    >  Security
	- all communication is encrypted end-to-end
        - AES cipher in CBC mode - secure data confidentiality
        - HMAC-SHA256 hash authentication - secure data authenticity
	- Base64 encode data for transport to prevent loss of binary, non-printables, or differing codecs
        - 256 bit keys generated each session via Diffie-Hellman transactionless key-agreement method


    ...and more!
