
     Problem:

     Is it possible to build an ultra-portable, stealthy and persistent worm which self-replicates by infecting host machines with the 
     purpose of building a peer-to-peer botnet that is written in pure python, has zero dependencies, runs on anything, requires no 
     manual configuration, automates host discovery, and autonomously discovers and analyzes hosts to then generate, configure, and 
     compile a unique encrypted deliverable for each target, utilizing mulitiple attack vectors for payload delivery, to gain a 
     foothold, establish persistence, while minimizing potential exposure of peers in the botnet - while all network communication is 
     encrypted end-to-end with state of the art cryptography?

     Solution:
